The event, organized by SAM-UP, a student academic organization in UPLB, was participated by students from different high schools nationwide. With this year's theme, &amp;quot;Connecting the Dots Between Sustainable Innovation and Mathematics&amp;quot;, Miyah discussed about Mathematics' role in Robotics specifically in control systems. Most of the students are already familiar with drones and its applications. She emphasized the importance of the knowledge in Mathematical concepts such as integral and derivatives in designing controllers for drones and robots in general.&lt;/p&gt;
