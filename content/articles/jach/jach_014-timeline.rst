Notes
-----

- **Time Management**: Each week’s tasks are designed to fit within 3 hours, with activities like literature summarization (~1-1.5 hours) and drafting (~1-1.5 hours) balanced for efficiency.
- **Gap Identification**: Weeks 1-2 (6 hours) ensure a robust gap analysis through literature review and validation with preprints.
- **Methods Development**: Weeks 8-9 (6 hours) allow detailed planning of system design, implementation, and testing, critical for systems research.
- **Streamlined Tasks**: The literature review (Weeks 3-5) is limited to 6-8 papers, and the evaluation plan (Week 10) is simplified to fit the reduced timeframe.
- **Tools**: Use Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and arXiv for research, Zotero for citations, and LaTeX/Word with IEEE/ACM templates for drafting.
- **Deliverable Scope**: The final proposal (5-8 pages) is suitable for a conference or funding application, with a well-defined gap and detailed methods.
- **Validation**: The extended gap and methods phases ensure depth, with tasks building progressively.
