As UPLB shift to online classes `starting Monday`_, most of the academic work will be done with your computer. During these times, you want your computer to be reliable and capable of your needs. If you think your computer is running slow or if you just want to utilize 100% of your computer's processing power, this blog is for you.

Listed in this blog are several ways on how you can improve your computer's performance, even if it is laptop or a desktop, or a first generation machine (*not talking about* ENIAC_ *'s though*).

In improving a computer's performance, two key factors are considered: **hardware** and **software**. Hardware pertains to the physical components of your device (e.g. storage device, memory module, processor, etc.); software pertains to the programs installed and running on your device (e.g. operating system, anti-virus software, browser, etc.).
